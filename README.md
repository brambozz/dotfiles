# dotfiles

This repo contains various configuration files. This readme explains for some programs reasons for specific choices and links to useful information so that I can find stuff back later.

# Neovim

I have chosen to use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my default text editor. An interesting article that helped choosing between vim and neovim can be found [here](https://geoff.greer.fm/2015/01/15/why-neovim-is-better-than-vim/).
As I am learning vim, I will update my choices for keyboard remapping below. Since I use colemak, keys may not always remain logical. I will strive for ergonomics, but focus on learning to use vim first. However, since I plan on switching to more vim-like applications (e.g. terminal file manager, qutebrowser) the movement keys are probably important.

## hjkl

This is a tricky debate (see [1], [2] or [3]). In conclusion, I do not like the idea of doing the h-stretch for navigation, but in vim you should hardly use that anyways. However, in browsing/file manager these movements may become more common. So I will put everything on jkl; as follows: j = down, k = up, l = right, ; = left. Keeping j and k as they are, because you use those most frequent, so index and middle finger is nice. Left movement is least occuring (see [3]), so pinky should be fine.
